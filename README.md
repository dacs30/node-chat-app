# node-chat-app

## Introduction

Hello! This is a simple chat-app made with node.js and socket.io

## About the code

The code is divided in two three main sections: server socketio, client socketio and the frontend
(basic html and css). You can see everything in the way the folders are organized.

## Thanks!
